- _output_folder_: Folder where all the output files (logs, reports, db...) are going to be generated. It does not need to exist previously
- _log_filename_: Log file name
- _db_filename_: DB file name
- _allowed users_: An array with the Telegram User ID's of the contributors to the household management. If you don't know it, an easy way of obtaining it is by running the bot, and checking the log. You'll find some trace like 
```log
2025-10-03 23:53:02,222 - __main__ - INFO - Not Allowed user: '<your_user>' with username '<your_user_id>' and id '<your_user_id>'
```
- _texts_: Texts used during the flow of the different executions
- _gdrive_: Google Drive configuration. **More info bellow**
- _gdrive -> active_: Set to true if you want to use Google Drive
- _gdrive -> creadentials_file_: Location of the file which contains the Google Drive credentials
- _gdrive -> sheet_name_: Sheet name
- _gdrive -> share_mails_: Google users which will have access to the shared sheet

## gdrive_credentials.json
**_gdrive -> active_ should be set to true**

Rename the "gdrive_credentials_example.json" file to "gdrive_credentials.json".

Here comes the tricky part. We need to create a Service Account in Google Cloud:
1. First, we need to create a project in [Google Cloud](https://console.cloud.google.com/welcome). For example, call it "household_expenses"
2. Go into the project and enable the **Google Drive API** and **Google Sheets API**
3. Create a **Service Account** within the project, giving it the **Owner** role
4. Open the Service Account, go to the **Keys** section, and create a new key in JSON format
5. Voil√†
